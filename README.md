SoxKeeper
==========

A simple web app that allows the recording of baseball games attended.

Don't worry, I think I've realized that a Javascript MVC framework will be a much better way to do this.

## Keeps track of:
	* date of game
	* home/away
	* opponent
	* win/loss
	* score
	* Red Sox starting pitcher
	* opponent starting pitcher
	* notes
